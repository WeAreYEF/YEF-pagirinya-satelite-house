# Outcome
1. After their training, they are expected to be able to produce good quality products leading to improved and increased personal and household income levels and profitability. 
2. Secondly they will be able to effectively work in their village settings able to creating jobs among themselves. While unemployment has become the most pressing issue among the refugee and host community youths, self-employment is growing as a viable career path that is available to the majority of youth. Yet, an entrepreneurship ecosystem conducive for youth to start, grow, and sustain their businesses is still lacking.

# Challenge for the selection of the Project
Challenges and difficult circumstances that young people in the region face are; 
- Due to limited opportunities for education and training, viable employment, health and social services, and because of a growing incidence of substance abuse and juvenile delinquency. It is noticed that 60% of youths in their productive years, lack direction which has contributed greatly in affecting the development and economic out-put of the country. Their imagination, ideas, considerable energies and vision are essential for the continuing development of the societies in which they live.
