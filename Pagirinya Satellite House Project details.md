## Our Vision:
Develop an ICT and youth led skills enhanced Social Network Space (SNS) for effective peace education and, mobilization and empowerment of youth in south Sudanese refugee camps and host communities.

## Goal of the project:
The main goal of the project is aimed at informing, empowering, educating, inspiring and gather the youths to solve their problems in which the youth are involved in positive activities that will ensure socio-economic development. Through SATELLITE vision is to press the youth into front line to bring sustainable development and becoming community problems solvers.

## Developing the SATELLITE node at Pagirinya
This approach involves developing an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enhanced Social Network Space (SNS), equipped as a small common-use centre (Satellite) working in tandem cooperation with the local school where an experienced volunteer team of YEF social scientist or workers equipped with ICT skills and knowledge’s will interact with their South Sudanese youth counterparts as a resource hub applying, for example ICT skills in social media for peace education, reconciliation and experience sharing (retelling conflict/violence stories in loving perspectives).

The purpose of the SATELLITE is to provide Youth and Community Open Resource Center to enable essential information services for young people, available for general community use. It is envisaged that the Satellite will create an inviting and vibrant community space where people, can meet, connect, interact, receive training, counseling and enjoy a range of social and recreational activities. The services are given to the youths and the community (adults) free of charge – or in cases as they develop for minimal cost, which can include an exchange of goods and services (for example, via repair cafés).
